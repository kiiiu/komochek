# Snake ball

Recently, an unusual slot machine appeared in the amusement park: a shimmering ball, 
the entrance of which is the carnivorous open mouth of a huge snake with fiery red eyes. 
someone unknown asks questions inside this ball and if you answer all three correctly 
you could travel to a hot tropical country.
